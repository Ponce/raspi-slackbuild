Kernel SlackBuild for Raspberry Pi

Before running this SlackBuild you must get a tarball of the kernel
source from the 3.6.y branch of the raspberrypi's repository: a
script is here to help that (if you haven't already run it through
the get_needed_files.sh in the main folder)

  sh get_kernel_source.sh
