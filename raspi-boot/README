Boot Firmware SlackBuild for Raspberry Pi 
(includes build of the userland libraries)

Before you run this SlackBuild you must get a tarball of the firmware
and the sources of the userland libraries from the raspberrypi's github
repository: two scripts are here to help that (if you haven't already
run them through the get_needed_files.sh in the main folder)

  sh get_firmware.sh
  sh get_userland.sh
