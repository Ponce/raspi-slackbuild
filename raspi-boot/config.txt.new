# gpu_mem=32 means that 32 Mb of the raspberrypi's RAM will be used for
# the GPU, leaving 224 Mb for the operating system (if the raspberrypi
# got a total of 256Mb RAM). You can change this default as needed,
# should handle 256M and 512M parts.
# The start_cd.elf and fixup_cd.dat will be used when gpu_mem=16
